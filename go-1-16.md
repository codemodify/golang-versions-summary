# Go 1.16
-------
+ Go 1 compatibility promise (https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1compat)
+ changes in toolchain, runtime, and libraries
+ no changes to the language
+ platforms
	+ `darwin/arm64` renamed to `ios/arm64`
	+ `ios/amd64` targets the iOS simulator running on AMD64-based macOS
	+ `darwin/arm64` (Apple Silicon), supports cgo, internal and external linking, c-archive, c-shared, and pie build modes, and the race detector.
	+ `GOOS=ios` implies the darwin build tag
	+ `GOOS=android` implies the linux build tag
	+ `go help buildconstraint` for details
	+ `netbsd/arm64`
	+ `openbsd/mips64`
	+ `openbsd/amd64` and `openbsd/arm64`
		+ system calls are now made through libc, instead of directly using the SYSCALL/SVC instruction
		+ OpenBSD 6.9 onwards will require system calls to be made through libc for non-static Go binaries
	- drops support for x87 mode compilation (GO386=387)
		- Support for non-SSE2 processors is now available using soft float mode (GO386=softfloat)
	+ `linux/riscv64` supports `cgo` and `-buildmode=pie`
		+ performance optimizations and code generation improvements for RISC-V.
	- Go 1.16 is the last release that will run on macOS 10.12 Sierra
		- Go 1.17 will require macOS 10.13 High Sierra or later

+ tools
	+ `GO111MODULE=on` by default
	+ `go build` and `go test` no longer modify `go.mod` and `go.sum` by default
	+ `go install` accepts versions (ex: go install example.com/cmd@v1.0.0)
		+ ignoring the go.mod file in the current directory or any parent directory
		+ useful for installing executables without affecting the dependencies of the main module
	+ `go install` the recommended way to build and install packages in module mode
	+ `go get -d` should be used to adjust the current module dependencies without building packages (the -d flag will always be enabled in the future)
	- `go get` to build and install packages is deprecated
	+ `retract` used in `a go.mod` indicate a certain published versions of the module should not be used by other modules
	+ `go mod vendor -e` and `go mod tidy -e` proceed despite errors in resolving missing packages
	+ `//go:embed` to include static files and file trees as part of the final executable
	+ `go test -c` or `go test -i` reports an error with unknown flags
	+ `go get -insecure` deprecated and will be removed
		+ use `GOINSECURE` env instead to fetch over http
		+ use `GOPRIVATE` or `GONOSUMDB` env to bypass module sum validation
		+ see `go help environment`
	+ `GOVCS` env is a new var that limits which version control tools the go command may use to download source code
		+ see `go help vcs`
	+ `-toolexec` is set then `TOOLEXEC_IMPORTPATH` env is set to the import path of the package being built
	- `-i` for `go build` `go install` `go test` is deprecated
	+ `cgo` will no longer try to translate C struct bitfields into Go struct fields
		+ order in which C bitfields appear in memory is implementation dependent, so in some cases the cgo tool produced results that were silently incorrect
	+ `vet` warns about invalid calls to the testing.T method Fatal from within a goroutine
	+ `vet` warns about amd64 assembly that clobbers the BP register (the frame pointer)
	+ `vet` warns about incorrectly passing a non-pointer or nil argument to asn1.Unmarshal

+ runtime
	+ `runtime/metrics` interface for reading implementation-defined metrics from the Go runtime
		+ `runtime.ReadMemStats`, `debug.GCStats`
		+ significantly more general and efficient
		+ `GODEBUG=inittrace=1` causes the runtime to emit a single line to standard error for each package init
	+ on Linux releasing memory to the operating system promptly (MADV_DONTNEED)
		- instead of lazily when the operating system is under memory pressure(MADV_FREE)
		- means process-level memory statistics like RSS will more accurately reflect
		- no need to use `GODEBUG=madvdontneed=1` anymore
	+ Go 1.16 fixes a discrepancy between the race detector and the Go memory model
	+ compiler can now inline functions with non-labeled for loops, method values, and type switches

+ linker
	+ is 20-25% faster than 1.15 and requires 5-15% less memory on average
	+ binaries are also smaller as a result of more aggressive symbol pruning
	+ `go build -buildmode=c-shared` now generates Windows ASLR DLLs by default
		+ ASLR can be disabled with --ldflags=-aslr=false

+ core library
	+ `io/fs` defines `fs.FS` interface, an abstraction for read-only trees of files
	- `io/ioutil` is deprecated
		- `ioutil.Discard` => `io.Discard`
		- `ioutil.NopCloser` => `io.NopCloser`
		- `ioutil.ReadAll `=> `io.ReadAll`
		- `ioutil.ReadDir` => `os.ReadDir` (note: returns a slice of os.DirEntry rather than a slice of fs.FileInfo)
		- `ioutil.ReadFile` => `os.ReadFile`
		- `ioutil.TempDir` => `os.MkdirTemp`
		- `ioutil.TempFile` => `os.CreateTemp`
		- `ioutil.WriteFile` => `os.WriteFile`
	+ `crypto/hmac.New()` panic if separate calls to the hash generation function fail to return new values
	- `crypto/dsa` is deprecated
	+ `crypto/tls` has `net.ErrClosed` to detect a closed connection: `errors.Is(err, net.ErrClosed)`
	+ clients return a handshake error if the server selects an ALPN protocol that was not in the list advertised by the client.
	+ servers will now prefer other available AEAD cipher suites (such as ChaCha20Poly1305) over AES-GCM
		+ if either the client or server does not have AES hardware support
		+ unless both Config.PreferServerCipherSuites and Config.CipherSuites are set
		+ the client is assumed not to have AES hardware support if it does not signal
		+ a preference for AES-GCM cipher suites.
	+ `crypto/x509`
		+ `GODEBUG=x509ignoreCN=0` will be removed in Go 1.17
			+ enables the legacy behavior of treating the CommonName field on X.509 certificates
				as a host name when no Subject Alternative Names are present.
		+ `ParseCertificate` and `CreateCertificate` enforce encoding restrictions
			for `DNSNames`, `EmailAddresses`, `URIs`, only ASCII range
		+ `CreateCertificate` verifies generated certificate signature using the signer
			public key. If the signature is invalid, an error is returned, instead of a
			malformed certificate.
		+ `DSA` signature verification is no longer supported.
		+ `Certificate.Verify` on Windows, will return all certificate chains that are
			built by the platform certificate verifier, instead of just the highest ranked chain
		+ `SystemRootsError.Unwrap` allows accessing the `Err` field through the errors package
		+ on Unix the package is more efficient in how it stores its copy of the system cert pool.
			programs that use only a small number of roots will use around a half megabyte less memory.
	+ `debug/elf` more DT and PT constants have been added
	+ `encoding/asn1` `Unmarshal` and `UnmarshalWithParams` returns error instead of panicking
		when the argument is not a pointer or is nil
	+ `encoding/json` json struct field tags understood by Marshal, Unmarshal, and related functionality
		now permit semicolon characters within a JSON object name for a Go struct field.
	+ `encoding/xml` case sensitive avoid using namespace prefixes beginning with xml
	+ `flag.Func()` allows registering a flag implemented by calling a function
	+ `go/build`
		+ new fields that report information about //go:embed
			+ `EmbedPatterns`, `EmbedPatternPos`, `TestEmbedPatterns`, `TestEmbedPatternPos`,
				`XTestEmbedPatterns`, `XTestEmbedPatternPos`
		+ `IgnoredGoFiles` does not include "_" or ".", they are always ignored
			IgnoredGoFiles is for files ignored because of build constraints
		+ `IgnoredOtherFiles` a list of non-Go files ignored because of build constraints
	+ `go/build/constraint`
		+ parses build constraint lines
			+ // +build
			+ //go:build (will be introduced in Go 1.17, and here to parse Go 1.17 code
	+ `html/template`
		+ `template.ParseFS`, `template.Template.ParseFS` are similar to `template.ParseGlob` and
			`template.Template.ParseGlob`, but read the templates from an `fs.FS`
	+ `io`
		+ `ReadSeekCloser`
		+ moved `Discard`, `NopCloser`, and `ReadAll` from `ioutil`
	+ `log.Default` provides access to the default Logger
	+ `log/syslog.Writer` uses the local message format
	+ `mime/multipart/Reader.ReadForm` no longer rejects form data when passed the
		maximum int64 value as a limit
	+ `net`
		+ I/O on a closed network connection can be detected using `errors.Is(err, net.ErrClosed)`
		+ the default TCP listener backlog size on Linux systems, set by /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn,
			was limited to a maximum of 65535. On Linux kernel version 4.1 and above, the maximum is
			now 4294967295
		+ On Linux, host name lookups no longer use DNS before checking /etc/hosts when
			/etc/nsswitch.conf is missing; this is common on musl-based systems and makes Go programs
			match the behavior of C programs on those systems.
	+ `net/http`
		+ `StripPrefix` changed to strip the prefix from the request `URL.RawPath` field in addition
			to its `URL.Path` field
	+ rejects `"Range": "bytes=--N"` with `416 "Range Not Satisfiable"`
	+ cookies set with `SameSiteDefaultMode` now behave according to the current spec (no attribute is set)
		instead of generating a SameSite key without a value.
	+ `Client` sends explicit `Content-Length: 0` in PATCH requests with empty body
		matching the existing behavior of POST and PUT
	+ `ProxyFromEnvironment` function no longer returns the setting of the `HTTP_PROXY` env
		for `https://` URLs when `HTTPS_PROXY` is unset.
	+ `Transport` has a `GetProxyConnectHeader` that can point to to a function that returns headers to
		send to a proxy during a CONNECT request. It is a dynamic version of the existing field
		`ProxyConnectHeader`, if `GetProxyConnectHeader` is not nil, then `ProxyConnectHeader` is ignored
	+ `net/http/httputil`
		+ `ReverseProxy` flushes buffered data more aggressively when proxying streamed responses
			with unknown body lengths.
	+ `net/smtp`
		+ `Client.Mail()` sends `SMTPUTF8` directive to servers that support it
	+ `os`
		+ `Process.Signal` returns `ErrProcessDone` instead of `errFinished` when already finished
		+ `DirEntry` alias for `fs.DirEntry`
		+ `ReadDir`, `File.ReadDir` read the contents of a directory into a slice of `DirEntry`
		+ `File.Readdir` lower case still exists, returning a slice of `FileInfo`
		+ `CreateTemp`, `MkdirTemp`, `ReadFile`, `WriteFile` moved from `io/ioutil`
		+ `FileInfo`, `FileMode`, `PathError` alias for `io/fs`
		+ `DirFS` function provides an implementation of `fs.FS` backed by a tree of os system files
	+ `os/signal`
		+ `NotifyContext` creating contexts that are canceled upon arrival of specific signals
	+ `path`
		+ `Match` returns an error if the unmatched part of the pattern has a syntax error
	+ `path/filepath`
		+ `WalkDir` typically more efficient than `Walk`
			function passed to WalkDir receives a `fs.DirEntry` instead of a `fs.FileInfo`
	+ `reflect.Zero`  optimized to avoid allocations
		+ compares of `Value` to `Value` using `==` or `DeepEqual` may get different results
		+ the documentation for `reflect.Value` describes how to compare two Values correctly
	+ `runtime/debug`
		+ `runtime.Error` values used when `SetPanicOnFault` is enabled may now have an `Addr` method,
			if that method exists, it returns the memory address that triggered the fault
	+ `strconv`
		+ `ParseFloat` uses the Eisel-Lemire algorithm, 2x performance
		+ speed up decoding textual formats like encoding/json
	+ `syscall`
		+ `NewCallback`, `NewCallbackCDecl` correctly support callback functions with multiple
			sub-uintptr-sized arguments in a row
		+ win: `SysProcAttr` has a new `NoInheritHandles` field that disables inheriting handles
			when creating a new process
		+ win: `DLLError` has `Unwrap()` for unwrapping
		+ lin: `Setgid`, `Setuid`, and related are implemented.
		+ lin: `AllThreadsSyscall`, `AllThreadsSyscall6` may be used to make a system call on all
			Go threads in the process. These functions may only be used by programs that do not
			use `cgo`; if a program uses `cgo`, they will always return `syscall.ENOTSUP`
	+ `testing/iotest`
		+ `ErrReader()` returns an `io.Reader` that always returns an error
		+ `TestReader()` function tests that an `io.Reader` behaves correctly
	+ `text/template`
		+ Newlines characters are now allowed inside action delimiters, permitting actions to span
			multiple lines.
		+ `template.ParseFS()` and `template.Template.ParseFS()` are like `template.ParseGlob` and
			`template.Template.ParseGlob` but read the templates from an `fs.FS`
	+ `text/template/parse`
		+ `CommentNode` was added to the parse tree, accessed using `parse.Tree().Mode`
	+ `time/tzdata`
		+ uses slim timezone data format from $GOROOT/lib/time/zoneinfo.zip and is embedded.
			reduces the size of the timezone database by about 350 KB.
	+ `unicode`
		+ upgraded from Unicode 12.0.0 to Unicode 13.0.0
		+ adds 5,930 new characters
		+ four new scripts
		+ 55 new emoji
